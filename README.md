# ðŸ’° Billionaires Project  

## Info-Data

My engagement with the market and investments was the initial driving force behind this project. Wanting to explore the world's wealthiest individuals, so here i use data visualization to analyze the trends, industries, and countries that dominate the billionaire landscape. The dataset contains statistics on the world's billionaires, including information about their businesses, industries, and personal details. It provides insights into the wealth distribution, business sectors, and demographics of billionaires worldwide from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset)
